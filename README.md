# NumpSy

Straight up mix between NumPy, SymPy and Pandas into a single extendable framework. 

Future usage examples to follow.

### Is it any good?
I think it's an elegant mathematical representation to simultanously perform symbolic, numerical, and data science operations into a single system.

### Future plans
* Extend unit management and verification.
* Create a full constants list, probably even in Excel or as an importable CSV file into Pandas.

Open to contributions.
