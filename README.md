# NumpSy

Straight up mix between NumPy, SymPy and Pandas into a single extendable framework. 

Future usage examples to follow.

## Quick Start

Local install after downloading the Anaconda distribution or equivalent:
```
>>> git clone https://github.com/daquintero/numpsy.git
>>> cd numpsy
>>> python3 setup.py install
```

## Quick Example
```
import numpsy as nsy


```

### Is it any good?
I think it's an elegant mathematical representation to simultanously perform symbolic, numerical, and data science operations into a single system.

### Future plans
* Extend unit management and verification.
* Create a full constants list, probably even in Excel or as an importable CSV file into Pandas.

Open to contributions.
