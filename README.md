# NumpSy

Straight up mix between NumPy, SymPy and Pandas into a value single-declaration extendable framework to simulatenously perform symbolic and numerical operations.

Objectives:
1. Aid mathematical system derivation, understanding, analysis and scientific functionality. 


## Quick Start

Local install after downloading the Anaconda distribution or equivalent:
```
>>> git clone https://github.com/daquintero/numpsy.git
>>> cd numpsy
>>> python3 setup.py install
```

## Quick Example
```
import numpsy as nsy

# Create a unit and operate with it
>>> farad_unit = nsy.Unit(name="Farad", symbol="F")
>>> farad_unit.s
F
>>> farad_per_meter = farad_unit / nsy.Unit("Meter", "m")
>>> farad_per_meter
F/m

# Create a constant
>>> e_0 = nsy.Constant(name="permittivity_vaccum", symbol= "\epsilon_0", number=8.8541878128e-12, unit=farad_per_meter)
>>> e_0.s
\epsilon_0
>>> e_0.n
8.8541878128e-12

# Operate between Value objects
>>> roadtrip_distance = nsy.Variable(name="roadtrip_distance", symbol= "r", number=100, unit=nsy.Unit("meter", "m"))
>>> car_speed = nsy.Variable(name="car_speed", symbol= "c", number=20, unit= nsy.Unit("meter", "m") / nsy.Unit("second", "s") )
>>> time_to_arrive = roadtrip_distance / car_speed
>>> time_to_arrive.n
5.0

### Is it any good?
I think it's an elegant mathematical representation to simultanously perform symbolic, numerical, and data science operations into a single system.

### Future plans
* Extend unit management and verification.
* Create a full constants list, probably even in Excel or as an importable CSV file into Pandas.
