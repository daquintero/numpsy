# NumpSy

Straight up mix between NumPy, SymPy and Pandas into a value single-declaration extendable framework to simulatenously perform symbolic and numerical operations.

Objectives:
1. Ever think you wanted to simultaneously perform numerical and symbolic mathematics for an engineering or optimization derivation? Now you can pretty much intuitively derivate simultaneously whilst performing unit management automatically.
2. Integrate mathematical analytical derivation Python toolchains into a single handy one that retains and expands each of the constituent packages methods. Retain intuitive compatibility.
3. Have fun!

### Is it any good?
I think it's an elegant mathematical representation to simultanously perform symbolic, numerical, and data science operations into a single system. It targets a minimal overhead to raw numpy, sympy or scipy operations.
